These are low stakes assessments (i.e. you get credit for doing them, not based upon how you did). I will use the results to inform my instruction.\nPart 1 Complete this Google Form. The purpose of this survey is for me to get to know you better. There is no passing or failing, right or wrong answers. Please answer each section honestly. I will use the results in aggregate to inform the instruction in this class.\nPart 2 The Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) is a formative assessment designed to provide you with information about key college skills. DAACS includes assessments in self-regulated learning, mathematics, reading, and writing. YOU ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE SELF-REGULATED LEARNING ASSESSMENT. This should take about 10 minutes to complete the assessment and there is no passing or failing. Once you are done, I encourage you to review the resources recommended to you. We will use the aggregated results in class. To get credit for this assignment:\n Go to my.daacs.net Create an account. Please use the email address entered in the Google form in Part 1. Complete the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) assessment.  You will receive an email from me through DAACS inviting you to a course within DAACS.

From Wikipedia:\n  Q–Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. First, the set of intervals for the quantiles is chosen. A point (x, y) on the plot corresponds to one of the quantiles of the second distribution (y-coordinate) plotted against the same quantile of the first distribution (x-coordinate). Thus the line is a parametric curve with the parameter which is the number of the interval for the quantile.\n  Let’s begin with a vector of values, mpg from the mtcars data frame.

Identify the relationship between multiple variables (i.e. independent vs. dependent). Define variables that are not associated as independent. Be able to describe and identify the difference between observational and experimental studies. Distinguish between simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling, and recognize the benefits and drawbacks of choosing one sampling scheme over another. Identify the four principles of experimental design and recognize their purposes: control any possible con- founders, randomize into treatment and control groups, replicate by using a sufficiently large sample or repeating the experiment, and block any variables that might influence the response.

Use different measures of center and spread and be able to describe the robustness of different statistics. Describe the shape of distributions vis-a-vis histograms and boxplots. Create and intepret contingency and frequency tables (one- and two-way tables).  Supplemental Readings  OpenIntro Statistics slides ggplot2 - ggplot2 is an R package by Wickham that implements the grammer of graphics (Wilkinson, 2005) in R. I will frequently make use of the graphing framework throughout the course and is worth learning. Visualizing Likert Data - An R package for visualizing Likert scale data built on the ggplot2 framework. Quick-R base graphics - Covers many of the visualizations using R\u0026amp;rsquo;s base graphics.  Videos Summarizing and Graphing Numerical Data\n Exploring Categorical Data\n Note about Pie Charts There is only one pie chart in OpenIntro Statistics (Diez, Barr, \u0026amp;amp; ??etinkaya-Rundel, 2015, p. 48). Consider the following three pie charts that represent the preference of five different colors. Is there a difference between the three pie charts? This is probably a difficult to answer.\nHowever, consider the bar plot below. Here, we cleary see there is a difference between the ratio of the three colors.

Define and describe the law of large numbers. Distinguish disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) and independent events. Use Venn diagrams to represent events and their probabilities. Describe probability distributions. Distinguish between marginal and conditional probabilities. Use tree diagrams and/or Bayes Theorem to calculate conditional probabilities and probabilities of intersection of non-independent events. The expected value of a discrete random variable is computed by adding each outcome weighted by its probability.\n$$ E(X)=\\mu=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}{{x}_{i}P\\left(X={x}_{i}\\right)} $$ The variance of a discrete random variable is computed by adding each squared deviation of an outcome from the expected value weighted by its probability. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n$$ Var(X)={\\sigma}^{2}=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}{{\\left({x}_{i}-\\mu\\right)}P\\left(X={x}_{i}\\right) } $$ The average of a linear combination of discrete random variables is computed as the sum of their averages, weighted by the constant multipliers. The variance of a linear combination of independent discrete random variables is computed as the sum of their variances, weighted by the square of the constant multipliers. The distribution of a continuous random variable is described by the probability density function. The total area under the density curve is 1. Probabilities under the density curve can be calculated as the area under the curve. The probability of a continuous random variable being exactly equal to a value is 0, since there is no area under the curve at a given location. …","date":1493483784,"description":"","lastmod":"2017-04-29T18:36:24+02:00","objectID":"6853b787355469666e72a1c8e0433958","permalink":"/chapters/chapter3/","publishdate":"2017-04-29T18:36:24+02:00","title":"Chapter 3"},{"content":"MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { inlineMath: [[\u0026#39;$\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;$\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;\\\\(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\\\\)\u0026#39;]], displayMath: [[\u0026#39;$$\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;$$\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;\\[\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\\]\u0026#39;]], processEscapes: true, processEnvironments: true, skipTags: [\u0026#39;script\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;noscript\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;style\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;textarea\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;pre\u0026#39;], TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: \u0026#34;AMS\u0026#34; }, extensions: [\u0026#34;AMSmath.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AMSsymbols.js\u0026#34;] } } });   Distributions of Random Variables Learning Outcomes  Define the standardized (Z) score of a data point as the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean: $Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. Use the Z score  if the distribution is normal: to determine the percentile score of a data point (using technology or normal probability tables) regardless of the shape of the distribution: to assess whether or not the particular observation is considered to be unusual (more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean)   Depending on the shape of the distribution determine whether the median would have a negative, positive, or 0 Z score. Assess whether or not a distribution is nearly normal using the 68-95-99.7% rule or graphical methods such as a normal probability plot.  Reading: Section 4.1 of OpenIntro Statistics Test yourself: True/False: In a right skewed distribution the Z score of the median is positive.   If X is a random variable that takes the value 1 with probability of success $p$ and 0 with probability of success $1-p$, then $X$ is a Bernoulli random variable. The geometric distribution is used to describe how many trials it takes to observe a success.

Recognize that point estimates (such as the sample proportion) will vary from one sample to another, and define this variability as sampling variation. Calculate the sampling variability of the proportion, the standard error, as $SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$, where $p$ is the population proportion.  Note that when the population proportion $p$ is not known (almost always), this can be estimated using the sample proportion, $SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$.   Standard error measures the variability in point estimates from different samples of the same size and from the same population, i.e. measures the sampling variability. Recognize that when the sample size increases we would expect the sampling variability to decrease.  Conceptually: Imagine taking many samples from the population. When sample sizes are large the sample proportion will be much more consistent across samples than when the sample sizes are small. Mathematically: $SE = ???$, when $n$ increases, $SE$ will decrease since $n$ is in the denominator.

Note that when the population proportion $p$ is not known (almost always), this can be estimated using the sample proportion, $SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$.   Recognize that the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is about the distribution of point estimates, and that given certain conditions, this distribution will be nearly normal.  In the case of the proportion the CLT tells us that if \\  the observations in the sample are independent, \\ the sample size is sufficiently large (checked using the success/failure condition: $np \\ge 10$ and $n(1-p) \\ge 10$), \\\nthen the distribution of the sample proportion will be nearly normal, centered at the true population proportion and with a standard error of $\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$.

Explain why the $t$-distribution helps make up for the additional variability introduced by using $s$ (sample standard deviation) in calculation of the standard error, in place of $\\sigma$ (population standard deviation). Describe how the $t$-distribution is different from the normal distribution, and what ?heavy tail? means in this context. Note that the $t$-distribution has a single parameter, degrees of freedom, and as the degrees of freedom increases this distribution approaches the normal distribution. Use a $t$-statistic, with degrees of freedom $df = n - 1$ for inference for a population mean:  Standard error: $SE = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$ Confidence interval: $\\bar{x} \\pm t_{df}^\\star SE$ Hypothesis test: $T_{df} = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{SE}$ \\end{itemize}   Describe how to obtain a p-value for a $t$-test and a critical $t$-score ($t^\\star_{df}$) for a confidence interval. Define observations as paired if each observation in one dataset has a special correspondence or connection with exactly one observation in the other data set. Carry out inference for paired data by first subtracting the paired observations from each other, and then treating the set of differences as a new numerical variable on which to do inference (such as a confidence interval or hypothesis test for the average difference).

Note that the point estimates (estimated from observed data) for $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are $b_0$ and $b_1$, respectively.   When describing the association between two numerical variables, evaluate  direction: positive ($x \\uparrow, y \\uparrow$), negative ($x \\downarrow, y \\uparrow$) form: linear or not strength: determined by the scatter around the underlying relationship   Define correlation as the \\emph{linear} association between two numerical variables.  Note that a relationship that is nonlinear is simply called an association.   Note that correlation coefficient ($r$, also called Pearson\u0026amp;rsquo;s $r$) the following properties:  the magnitude (absolute value) of the correlation coefficient measures the strength of the linear association between two numerical variables the sign of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of association the correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1, inclusive, with -1 indicating perfect negative linear association, +1 indicating perfect positive linear association, and 0 indicating no \\emph{linear} relationship the correlation coefficient is unitless since the correlation coefficient is unitless, it is not affected by changes in the center or scale of either variable (such as unit …","date":1493483784,"description":"","lastmod":"2017-04-29T18:36:24+02:00","objectID":"f08b0e0a16eb2a4f1723169a7d8ab446","permalink":"/chapters/chapter8/","publishdate":"2017-04-29T18:36:24+02:00","title":"Chapter 8"},{"content":"MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: { inlineMath: [[\u0026#39;$\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;$\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;\\\\(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\\\\)\u0026#39;]], displayMath: [[\u0026#39;$$\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;$$\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;\\[\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;\\]\u0026#39;]], processEscapes: true, processEnvironments: true, skipTags: [\u0026#39;script\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;noscript\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;style\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;textarea\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;pre\u0026#39;], TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: \u0026#34;AMS\u0026#34; }, extensions: [\u0026#34;AMSmath.js\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AMSsymbols.js\u0026#34;] } } });   Multiple and Logistic Regression Learning Outcomes  Define the multiple linear regression model as $$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_k$$ where there are $k$ predictors (explanatory variables). Interpret the estimate for the intercept ($b_0$) as the expected value of $y$ when all predictors are equal to 0, on average. Interpret the estimate for a slope (say $b_1$) as \u0026amp;ldquo;All else held constant, for each unit increase in $x_1$, we would expect $y$ to increase/decrease on average by $b_1$.\u0026amp;rdquo; Define collinearity as a high correlation between two independent variables such that the two variables contribute redundant information to the model \u0026amp;ndash; which is something we want to avoid in multiple linear regression. Note that $R^2$ will increase with each explanatory variable added to the model, regardless of whether or not the added variables is a meaningful predictor of the response variable. Therefore we use adjusted $R^2$, which applies a penalty for the number of predictors included in the model, to better assess the strength of a multiple linear regression model: $$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{Var(e_i) / (n - k - 1)}{Var(y_i) / (n - 1)}$$ where $Var(e_i)$ measures the variability of residuals ($SS_{Err}$), $Var(y_i)$ measures the total variability in observed $y$ ($SS_{Tot}$), $n$ is the number of cases and $k$ is the number of predictors.  Note that adjusted $R^2$ will only increase if the added variable has a meaningful contribution to the amount of explained variability in $y$, i.e. if the gains from adding the variable exceeds the penalty.

Be sure to install R and RStudio on your own computers within the first few days of the class.\n R - download for Windows, Mac, or Linux. RStudio - Download Windows, Mac, or Linux versions from here  If using Windows, you also need to download RTools and ActivePerl.\nLaTeX LaTeX is a typesetting language for preparing documents. Documents are written in plain text files. Formatting the document is done using specific markup. If you have used HTML, the framework is similar however instead of using \u0026amp;lt;TAG\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;lt;/TAG\u0026amp;gt; syntax, LaTeX uses \\TAG{} format. We will primarily use Markdown, and its extension R Markdown for preparing documents in this class. However, when preparing PDF documents, the Markdown will first be converted to LaTeX before creating the PDF file. As such, a LaTeX converter is necessary. There are LaTeX installers for Windows (MiKTeX) and Mac (BasicTeX). Alternatively, the tinytex R package provides an easier way of installing LaTeX directly from within R:\n Copy install.packages(\u0026amp;#39;tinytex\u0026amp;#39;) tinytex::install_tinytex()    Source Control All course materials will be made available on Github which provides an implementation of the git open source version control system. RStudio supports git directly, but I recommend downloading Sourcetree. This is a free desktop client that provides an easier interface for working with Github. You will also need to create an account on Github.\nFor more information, Jenny Bryan\u0026amp;rsquo;s Happy Git and Github for the useR is a free online book covering the important features of source control for R users.\nR Packages Once everything is installed, execute the following command in RStudio to install the packages we will use for this class (you can copy-and-paste):\n Copy install.packages(c(\u0026amp;#39;openintro\u0026amp;#39;,\u0026amp;#39;OIdata\u0026amp;#39;,\u0026amp;#39;devtools\u0026amp;#39;,\u0026amp;#39;tidyverse\u0026amp;#39;, \u0026amp;#39;ggplot2\u0026amp;#39;, …","date":-62135596800,"description":"","objectID":"98b20e0a769d52e45135f2acf70a2939","permalink":"/course-overview/software/","title":"Software"},{"content":"Required \nDiez, D.M., Barr, C.D., \u0026amp;amp; Çetinkaya-Rundel, M.
